## &#128209; About

I am interested in using computation to address biological questions. Although I was familiar with interpreted languages like Python and Java, I wondered if I should learn a compiled language. I was reluctant because languages like C++ have a complex syntax; in addition, I did not find an immediate practical usage for a compiled language in the scientific environment. 

However, after I read ["Why scientists are turning to Rust"](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-03382-2) in *Nature*, I got the motivation to start the journey of learning Rust. This repository is to follow my progress and to keep me motivated &#128170;.
