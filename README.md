I am interested in using computation to address biological questions. Although I was familiar with interpreted languages like Python and Java, I wondered if I should learn a compiled language. I was reluctant because languages like C++ have a complex syntax; in addition, I did not find an immediate practical usage for a compiled language in the scientific environment. 

However, after I read ["Why scientists are turning to Rust"](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-03382-2) in *Nature*, I got the motivation to start the journey of learning Rust. This repository is to follow my progress and to keep me motivated &#128170;&#127997;.

The repository will have the following folder organization:

## &#128217; Notes

I will take notes as Rust projects; they will be mostly adapted examples from the bibliography. The source code must be **self-explanatory** and maintain annotations at a minimum. 

I do not want to spend time deciding on a good folder structure, so I will broadly follow the same organization as *The Rust Programming Language* book.

In addition, To make me reviewing the notes easier, there will be an autogenerated Markdown file that contains the source code of all the Rust projects. 

## &#127939;&#127997; Exercises

I will store here exercises solved by myself. There aren't strict rules for naming the folders.

## &#128218; Bibliography

It stocks the bibliography in a BibTeX formatted file.
